# Futurecaster-RPG Webapp

This is an RPG webapp with a world map, dungeon maps, and JRPG-style battle interface. Contents of the `cursor-src/` directory were built using Cursor IDE.

## Installation

You will need the Phaser CLI to be globally installed:
`npm install -g phaser-cli`

Then install this webapp:
`cd cursor-src && npm i`

Make sure your local and global Phaser CLI versions match, or are at least compatible.

## Usage

To use RPG Webapp, follow these steps:

1. Run npm start to start the application.

If you encounter the error phaser-cli: command not found, it means that the Phaser CLI is not installed globally on your machine. Phaser CLI is a command line interface for Phaser which is used to start the application.

After installing Phaser CLI globally, you should be able to start the application without any issues.
